        This project appears to be a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here's an overview of the project structure and functionality based on the provided code: <br /><br />

        <b>Frontend (React.js):</b><br />

        The frontend code is structured using React.js.
        Components such as Profile, SignUp, and Login are used to manage different parts of the user interface.
        The Redux library is utilized for state management, allowing components to access and update global state variables.
        The project uses React Router DOM for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages without a full page reload.
        Authentication-related features like sign-up, login, and profile management are implemented on the frontend.
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Backend (Node.js with Express.js):</b>

        The backend is implemented using Node.js with the Express.js framework.
        Express.js routes are defined for handling authentication-related requests (sign-up, login, logout) and user-related requests (updating user profile, deleting user account).
        JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication. When a user logs in or signs up, a JWT token is generated and stored in a cookie for subsequent requests.
        The backend communicates with a MongoDB database using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Authentication and Authorization:</b>

        User authentication is handled using JWT tokens. When a user logs in, a token is generated and sent to the client, and subsequent requests are authenticated using this token.
        Routes are protected using middleware functions like verifyToken, which checks the validity of the JWT token before allowing access to protected routes.
        Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database to enhance security.
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Database (MongoDB):</b>

        MongoDB is used as the database to store user information.
        Mongoose is used to define schemas and interact with the MongoDB database from the Node.js application.
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Additional Notes:</b>

        The project includes functionality for updating user profiles, deleting user accounts, and handling sign-out requests.
        CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is configured to allow requests from specified origins.
        Error handling middleware is implemented to handle errors and return appropriate responses to the client.
        Overall, the project appears to be a full-stack web application for user authentication and profile management, with a focus on security and scalability. It leverages modern web development technologies and best practices to provide a seamless user experience.
